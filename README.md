## Picking the Data Set from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets 

[Download the dataset from kaggle here](https://www.kaggle.com/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams)

## Preparing the data

- import the dataset into R.

- Document the steps for the import process and any preprocessing had to be done prior to or after the import

## Analyzing the data
- Do the analysis for at least one categorical variable and at least one numerical variable. Show appropriate plots for the data. 

- Do the analysis for at least one set of two or more variables. Show appropriate plots for the data. 

- Pick one variable with numerical data and examine the distribution of the data. 

- Draw various random samples of the data and show the applicability of the Central Limit Theorem for this variable. 

- Show how various sampling methods can be used on the data. Make some conclusions if these samples are used instead of the whole dataset.
