# R-Project

1. Picking the Data Set from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets 

2. Preparing the data 
    • import the dataset into R. 
		
    •	Document the steps for the import process and any preprocessing had to be done prior to or after the import

3. Analyzing the data 

    •	Do the analysis for at least one categorical variable and at least one numerical variable. Show appropriate plots for the data. 

    •	Do the analysis for at least one set of two or more variables. Show appropriate plots for the data. 

    •	Pick one variable with numerical data and examine the distribution of the data. 

    •	Draw various random samples of the data and show the applicability of the Central Limit Theorem for this variable. 

    •	Show how various sampling methods can be used on the data. Make some conclusions if these samples are used instead of the whole dataset.
